org.civicoop.paymentarrangement
===============================

This extension adds two fields to a contribution:
- Payment arrangement: yes/no to determine if a payment arrangement has been made
- Arrangement details: a memo field to describe the details of the arrangement e.g. ('Payment will be made in cash in week 40')
